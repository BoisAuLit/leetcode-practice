# Backtracking
- Increamental construction
  - Build solutions **step by step**.
- Feasibility check (constraints)
  - At each step, the partial solution is checked against the problem constraints.
    - If it violates any constraints, then abort it.
    - If it doesn't violation constraints, then continue.
- Exploration of all valid solutions
  - Backtracking can find 1 or all valid solutions, depending on the problems requirements. It systematically explores all possible branches in a **depth-first** manner.


Core concepts of backtracking:
- Depth-first search
- Pruning
- Branching
